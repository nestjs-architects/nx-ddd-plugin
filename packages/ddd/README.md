# @nestjs-architects/nx-ddd-plugin -- DDD Plugin for Nx

This plugin installs schematics which automate slicing your Nx workspace into domains and layers according to DDD nad
Onion Architecture.

The generated access restrictions prevent unwanted access between libraries respecting layers and domains:

## Features

- üó∫Ô∏è Generating domains with domain libraries
- üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Adding linting rules for access restrictions between domains
- üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Adding linting rules for access restrictions between layers as proposed by Onion Architecture

## Usage

Add this plugin to an Nx workspace:

```
npm i -D @nestjs-architects/nx-ddd-plugin
```

Initialize linting rules

```
nx g @nestjs-architects/nx-ddd-plugin:add
```

Add domains:

```
nx g @nestjs-architects/nx-ddd-plugin:domain adoption
```

If you have a fullstack workspace you can separate those libraries from that for frontend by providing a grouping
directory

```
nx g @nestjs-architects/nx-ddd-plugin:domain adoption --directory server
```

## Generated Structure

The included schematics generate a folder for each domain. This folder contains all necessary libs to provide your
domain use cases logic.

## How to connect it with the App?

App should import an ui library as it is a way how the application provides the entrypoint to the business logic. This
plugin doesn't generate ui library generator as it doesn't have to be a part of any domain. Ui library can implement a
simple REST API for a specific domain, but also could represent a Backend for Frontend that orchestrate multiple domains
or could produce a classic html views containing data from many domains.

Furthermore, there are many options of the communication protocol you could want to use.
